# Private Cloud Configuration repo

The CS++ Private Cloud is an ongoing project to provide infrastructure for society members and other societies within the TUD society space.

##Â What we will provide

* A persistent linux environment for society members to work on personal projects and have easy access to development tools.
* Provisioning infrastructure for compute and storage.
* Hosting websites as a subdomain or through a personally funded custom domain.

This repository will contain scripts, configuration and docs for the following purposes:

* Bootstrapping fresh installs on compute servers.
* Configuration for all clusters run on the server.
* Onboarding new and current Sysadmins.
* Outlining the design of the infrastructure for visibility and auditing.
* Guides for members on how to leverage this infrastructure for their academic and personal work.
